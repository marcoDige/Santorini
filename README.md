## Instructions for build and execution:

The jar is the same for both server and client. You can build it under your preferred OS and launch it following the instructions below.
The project has been developed using JAVA 13 and JavaFX 14. 
The following terminals have been tested for the CLI: WSL (Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian), Windows Terminal and iTerm.

### Build instructions:

The jar is built using "Maven Shade Plugin": inside the IntelliJ IDE, clone the repository and launch "install" under "lifecycle" section in the Maven toolbar.
The generated jar will be placed in the "shade" folder of your project.

If you want to use Maven in the terminal, you can execute:
```
mvn install
```
In the project's root folder (same folder of "pom.xml").
The generated jar will be placed in the "shade" folder of your project.

### Execution instructions:

#### Server

In terminal execute:

```
java -jar AM10.jar -server
```
The server will be listening on the default port ```1234```.

Or if you would like to customize the port:

```
java -jar AM10.jar -server PORT
```

Where you can replace  ```PORT``` with your preferred port number. Example: ```java -jar AM10.jar -server 8080```

#### Client

To launch the game on the command line interface (CLI)  make sure your terminal is in fullscreen mode,
then execute:

```
java -jar AM10.jar -client -cli
```

To launch the program with the graphical user interface (GUI), double-click on the jar (on Ubuntu 20.04 first make sure to mark as executable the jar file).
You can also execute in the terminal:

```
java -jar AM10.jar -client -gui
```
or simply:
```
java -jar AM10.jar
```
